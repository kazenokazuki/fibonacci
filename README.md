# fibonacci
showing the different methods in outputing the fibonacci sequence to the nth element based on the paramater n. The first uses a loop for iteration while the second uses a recursive method.

#bubble_sort
sorts array by comparing pairs of values to the left and right iterating over the array until sorted. complexity O(n**2)

# merge_sort
merge sort method using recursive code. complexity O(nlogn)
